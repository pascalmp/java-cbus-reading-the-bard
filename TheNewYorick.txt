Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest
of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand
times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims
at it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft
Where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of
merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now
to mock your own grinning quite chap-fallen
Now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let her paint an
inch thick to this favour she must come make her laugh at that
